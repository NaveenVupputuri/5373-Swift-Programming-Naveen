###Abstract:
      At present we are used to do all our payments through smartphones, which increased the ease of doing our tasks. Near Field
      communication (NFC) is a magnificent technology used for mobile payment applications thereby creating a mobile wallet with
      virtual cards. It is a short-range wireless technology which allows transaction between devices with a simple tap or a wave 
      instead of carrying various cards or passes. It is based on Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) which generates 
      13.56 MHz spectrum for communication. And one more advantage is that it only takes 0.1 seconds approximately for the data 
      transfer.In this paper we explore various mobile payment applications like Google Wallet, MasterCard PayPass, Apple pay, 
      Visa payWave, Paypal etc.. And we also represent the implementation framework between financial service, customer and 
      merchant. Finally we discuss the security for the transactions which is the most important factor for the mobile payments.
