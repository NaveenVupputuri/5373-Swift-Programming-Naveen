## Question 1

``` swift
func backwards(s1: String, s2: String) -> Bool {
return s1 > s2
}
var reversed = sorted(names, backwards)
```

Replace the backward function using the closure

Hint: Closure Syntax

{ (parameters) -> return type in
    statements
}

## Question 2

``` swift
let interestingNumbers = [
    "Prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13],
    "Fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8],
    "Square": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
]
```

Use the for in loop to traverse through the dictionary to display value and its corresponding type.

Hint: Use tuple before in statement and nested loops are required


## Question 3

Types of Range Operators and give example?
